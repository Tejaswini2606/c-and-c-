<i>Bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum) causing a rapid wilting of tomato plants.
Bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum) causing a rapid wilting of tomato plants.
Bacterial wilt or Southern bacterial blight is a serious disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum (formerly Pseudomonas solanacearum). This bacterium survives in the soil for extended periods and enters the roots through wounds made by transplanting, cultivation or insects and through natural wounds where secondary roots emerge.
Disease development is favored by high temperatures and high moisture. The bacteria multiply rapidly inside the water-conducting tissue of the plant, filling it with slime. This results in a rapid wilt of the plant, while the leaves stay green. If an infected stem is cut crosswise, it will look brown and tiny drops of yellowish ooze may be visible.<br>
<b style="font-size: 50px;text-align:left">Prevention & Treatment:</b> Control of bacterial wilt of plants grown in infested soil is difficult. Rotation with non-susceptible plants, such as corn, beans and cabbage, for at least three years provides some control. Do not use pepper, eggplant, potato, sunflower or cosmos in this rotation. Remove and destroy all infected plant material. Plant only certified disease-free plants. The cultivar Kewalo is partially resistant to bacterial wilt, but is an uncommon cultivar. Chemical control is not available for this disease.</i>

		<b style="font-size: 90px">Bacterial spot</b><img src="bst.jpg" style="width=400px;">
<i>This disease is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas vesicatoria, which attacks green but not red tomatoes. Peppers are also attacked. The disease is more prevalent during wet seasons. Damage to the plants includes leaf and fruit spots, which result in reduced yields, defoliation and sun- scalded fruit. The symptoms consist of numerous small, angular to irregular, water-soaked spots on the leaves and slightly raised to scabby spots on the fruits. The leaf spots may have a yellow halo. The centers dry out and frequently tear.
The bacteria survive the winter on volunteer tomato plants and on infected plant debris. Moist weather is conducive to disease development. Most outbreaks of the disease can be traced back to heavy rainstorms that occurred in the area. Infection of leaves occurs through natural openings. Infection of fruits must occur through insect punctures or other mechanical injury.
Bacterial spot is difficult to control once it appears in the field. Any water movement from one leaf or plant to another, such as splashing rain drops, overhead irrigation, and touching or handling wet plants, may spread the bacteria from diseased to healthy plants.<br>
<b style="font-size: 50px;text-align:left">Prevention & Treatment:</b> Only use certified disease-free seed and plants. Avoid areas that were planted with peppers or tomatoes during the previous year. Avoid overhead watering by using drip or furrow irrigation. Remove all diseased plant material. Prune plants to promote air circulation. Spraying with a copper fungicide will give fairly good control the bacterial disease. Follow the instructions on the label. See Table 1 for fungicide products for home garden use.</i>

		<b style="font-size: 90px">Blossom end rot</b><img src="be.jpeg" style="width=400px;">
<i>Blossom end rot is a physiological disorder of tomato. Symptoms are water-soaked spots on the blossom end of the fruit. These spots enlarge and become black. Secondary infection by decay-causing organisms usually follows.
The cause of this disorder is a calcium deficiency in the developing fruit. Extreme fluctuations in moisture, rainy or cloudy weather with high humidity, cool temperatures, insufficient soil calcium, root pruning from nearby cultivation, and excessive ammoniacal (NH4 +) nitrogen, potassium, or magnesium fertilization can also increase the chances of blossom end rot, especially early in the season.<br>
<b style="font-size: 50px;text-align:left">Prevention & Treatment:</b>  Late spring planting of tomatoes should be at the recommended date for your area. The soil should be limed according to recommendations of a soil analysis report to bring the soil pH to 6.5, and to provide adequate calcium levels in the soil. Limestone is best applied 3 to 6 months in advance and tilled into the garden soil. Follow the soil report for recommendations for pre-plant nutrient (fertilizer) applications. If calcium levels are not sufficient but the soil pH is correct, then gypsum (calcium sulfate) is best tilled into the soil before planting at 1 to 2 pounds per 100 square feet.
Avoid excessive potassium or magnesium fertilization as these nutrients will compete with calcium for uptake by the plants. Epsom salts is an example of a magnesium source, so do not apply to garden soil unless a recent soil report indicates a magnesium deficiency.</i>

		<b style="font-size: 90px">tomato yello leaf curl</b><img src="lct.jpeg" style="width=400px;">
<i>omato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is not seed-borne, but is transmitted by whiteflies. This disease is extremely damaging to fruit yield in both tomato and pepper crops. Whiteflies may bring the disease into the garden from infected weeds nearby, such as various nightshades and jimsonweed. After infection, tomato plants may be symptomless for as long as 2 – 3 weeks.
Symptoms in tomato plants are the upward curling of leaves, yellow (chlorotic) leaf margins, smaller leaves than normal, plant stunting, and flower drop. If tomato plants are infected early in their growth, there may be no fruit formed. Infected plants may appear randomly throughout the garden. Pepper plants may also become infected, but will show no symptoms.nts.<br>
<b style="font-size: 50px;text-align:left">Prevention & Treatment:</b>  Removal of plants with initial symptoms may slow the spread of the disease. Rogued (pulled out) infected plants should be immediately bagged to prevent the spread of the whiteflies feeding on those plants. Keep weeds controlled within and around the garden site, as these may be alternate hosts for whiteflies. Reflective mulches (aluminum or silver-colored) can be used in the rows to reduce whitefly feeding.</i>

		<b style="font-size: 90px">Bacterial spot</b><img src="lmt.jpeg" style="width=400px;">
<i>The fungus Fulvia fulva causes leaf mold. It is first observed on older leaves near the soil where air movement is poor and humidity is high. The initial symptoms are pale green or yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface, which enlarge and turn a distinctive yellow.
Under humid conditions the spots on the lower leaf surfaces become covered with a gray, velvety growth of the spores produced by the fungus. When infection is severe, the spots coalesce, and the foliage is killed. Occasionally, the fungus attacks stems, blossoms and fruits. Green and mature fruit can have a black, leathery rot on the stem end.<br>
<b style="font-size: 50px;text-align:left">Prevention & Treatment:</b>Crop residue should be removed from the field. Staking and pruning to increase air circulation helps to control the disease. Avoid wetting leaves when watering. Rotate with vegetables other than tomatoes. Using a preventative fungicide program with chlorothalonil, mancozeb or copper fungicide, can control the disease. See Table 1 for fungicide products for home garden use.</i>

		<b style="font-size: 90px">Anthracnose</b><img src="anth.jpeg" style="width=400px;">
<i>Anthracnose on tomatoes is caused by the fungus Colletotrichum coccoides, which is primarily a pathogen of the tomato fruit. As the fruit are ripening, the symptoms first become noticeable as small, circular indented areas, which later develop darkened centers. The diseased spots continue to grow larger with time as each infection site also spreads deeper into the fruit. With warm, moist and humid weather (from rainfall or over-head irrigation) the fungus produces salmon-colored spores that are exuded from the black fungal material in the center of the spots. These spores are spread by splashing water.<br>
<b style="font-size: 50px;text-align:left">Prevention & Treatment:</b> Purchase disease free seed, as the fungus that causes anthracnose of tomato may be within the seed. Tomato seed may be treated by soaking them in hot water (122 ºF) for 25 minutes to destroy the fungus. Some varieties of tomatoes have resistance to anthracnose, such as Chef’s Choice Orange Hybrid.

Do not over-head irrigate tomatoes, as splashing water aids in the spread of fungal spores. Plant the garden in a sunny site and stake or cage tomato plants to provide better air movement and leaf drying conditions. Keep the garden weed free, as the presence of weeds may raise humidity levels around plants and slow drying conditions.

Because this disease affects other plants in the tomato family (Solanaceae), such as eggplants and peppers, the site for the tomatoes should not be planted again with solanaceous plants for at least a year. Some weeds that infest the garden are also in the same family, which is another reason to keep the garden free of weeds. Fungal spores can remain in the soil to infect plants the following year. Mulching the garden helps create a barrier between the soil surface and the fruit to reduce infections.

Some insects feed on ripe fruit, such as leaf-footed plant bugs and stink bugs. Their feeding punctures the skin of the fruit and allows the fungus to infect.

Harvest tomato fruit daily as soon as they are ripe.</i>

		<b style="font-size: 90px">Anthracnose</b><img src="anthracnose.jpg" style="width=400px;">
<i>Symptoms
Small, dark brown to black lesions on cotyledons; oval or eye-shaped lesions on stems which turn sunken and brown with purple to red margins; stems may break if cankers weaken stem; pods drying and shrinking above areas of visible symptoms; reddish brown spots on pods which become circular and sunken with rust colored margin.
Cause
Fungus
Comments
Disease transmitted through infected seed; fungus can survive in crop debris in soil and reinfect crop the following season.
Management
Plant resistant varieties; use certified disease free seed; avoid sprinkler irrigation, water plants at base; plow bean crop debris into soil.</i>

		<b style="font-size: 90px">Beanrust</b><img src="beanrust.jpg" style="width=400px;">
<i>Symptoms
Initially the symptoms appear as small yellow/white spots on leaves. Later the spots become enlarged and shows raised brick red rust pustules (uredinia). Normally this pustules are surrounded by a yellow halo. Premature leaf drop may occur if the disease is severe.
Cause
Fungus
Comments
Spores (urediniospores) spread from one field to another by air. The black teliospores formed at the end of the crop season overwinter in the field and act as inoculum for next season crops.
Management
Grow available resistant varieties. Remove and destroy the infected crop debris. Follow crop rotation. Keep the field free from weeds. If the disease is severe, spray suitable fungicide. at base; plow bean crop debris into soil.</i>

		<b style="font-size: 90px">whitemold</b><img src="whitemold.jpg" style="width=300px;">
<i>Symptoms
Flowers covered in white, cottony fungal growth; small, circular, dark green, water-soaked lesions on pods leaves and branches which enlarge and become slimy; cottony white growth may be visible on lesions during periods of high humidity; death of branches and/or entire plant.
Cause
Fungus
Comments
Fungus can survive in soil for in excess of 5 years; disease can be spread by wind, contaminated irrigation water and by infected seeds.
Management
There is no true immunity to white mold in any bean varieties; rotate crops with non-hosts like cereals and corn; plant rows parallel to direction of prevailing winds to prevent spread of disease from secondary hosts nearby; avoid excessive nitrogen fertilizer; use a wide row spacing.</i></div>
